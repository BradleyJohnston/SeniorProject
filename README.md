# SeniorProject

This is a first iteration of a Chess Engine. I learned a LOT from doing this. There is so many things to improve. This is just the first iteration, and it is messy enough that I want to start fresh so that I am no longer trying to work around the mess I have made. Learn from the past, move forward, etc.
